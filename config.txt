# DEVELOPMENT ONLY - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION
# This file stores the HMAC key in plaintext for convenience during development.
# 
# For secure key management, set the environment variable instead:
#   export SECUREFILE_HMAC_KEY="your-secret-key"
#
# If this file exists and the env var is NOT set, it will be used as a fallback.
# Remove this file and rely on environment variables for production deployments.
